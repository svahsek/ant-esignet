== MOSIP

*MOSIP* (Modular Open Source Identity Platform) is an open-source,
API-first identity management solution enabling countries to develop
national ID systems using open standards. It provides individuals with a
foundational identity, ensuring secure, scalable, and inclusive identity
management.

==== *How eSignet Integrates with MOSIP*

eSignet integrates with MOSIP through the *ID Authentication module*,
enabling secure identity verification and credential management via key
APIs:

* *KYC Authentication API*: Verifies user identities securely.
* *KYC Exchange API*: Shares encrypted KYC tokens.

==== Use Case 

===== Patient Access to Health Services 

A patient with a national ID can log in to an online health portal to
check appointments and health records. The login process is handled by
eSignet, which authenticates the patientâ€™s identity against the MOSIP
national ID system, ensuring secure access to personal health data. This
integration provides seamless, secure, and scalable access to healthcare
services while maintaining data privacy and authenticity.
