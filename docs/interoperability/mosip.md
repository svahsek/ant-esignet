# MOSIP

**MOSIP** (Modular Open Source Identity Platform) is an open-source, API-first identity management solution enabling countries to develop national ID systems using open standards. It provides individuals with a foundational identity, ensuring secure, scalable, and inclusive identity management.

### **How eSignet Integrates with MOSIP**

eSignet integrates with MOSIP through the **ID Authentication module**, enabling secure identity verification and credential management via key APIs:

* **KYC Authentication API**: Verifies user identities securely.
* **KYC Exchange API**: Shares encrypted KYC tokens.

#### Patient Access to Health Services <a href="#use-case-patient-access-to-health-services" id="use-case-patient-access-to-health-services"></a>

A patient with a national ID can log in to an online health portal to check appointments and health records. The login process is handled by eSignet, which authenticates the patientâ€™s identity against the MOSIP national ID system, ensuring secure access to personal health data. This integration provides seamless, secure, and scalable access to healthcare services while maintaining data privacy and authenticity.
