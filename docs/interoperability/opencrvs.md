# OpenCRVS

OpenCRVS (Open Civil Registration and Vital Statistics) is a digital system designed to capture and manage vital life events such as births, deaths, marriages, and divorces. It provides individuals with a legal identity and serves as a key source of demographic data, supporting policy-making, planning, and resource allocation. OpenCRVS ensures accurate registration of vital events, forming the foundation for a comprehensive and reliable identity management infrastructure.
