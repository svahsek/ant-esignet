# Login with Password

{% hint style="success" %}
**Prerequisites:**

The resident is registered with a username and password using eSignet's Signup portal. In the below demo application, we are using the resident's phone number as a username.
{% endhint %}

1\. On the portal, the resident clicks on the button **Sign In with eSignet**.

The login screen appears, and the resident is displayed with the options they can choose for login.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**\
If the `acr_values` the query parameter is presented with only one `acr` in the authorized URL, then the login options page is skipped, and the resident is directly taken to the login page.
{% endhint %}

2\. The resident needs to enter a registered username in the **Enter 8â€“9-digit mobile number** and password in the **Enter password** text field and check the box 'I'm not a robot'.

The password-based authentication is secured with a captcha.

4\. Next, the resident clicks the **Continue** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:

* The login with Password form also has a link to **Sign Up With Unified Login** to navigate to the Signup portal, if the resident is still not registered.
* **Forgot password** link is also available for resident to navigate to the signup portal to reset the password.
* Resident can resume back login after successful registration as well as after successful reset of password.
{% endhint %}

5\. The resident is then navigated to the Consent page. On this page, the **Essential** and **Voluntary** claims are displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consent screen is presented solely to the resident if consent has not previously been obtained. Additionally, a timer is incorporated into the Consent screen, allowing the resident to respond within the designated time frame. If the allotted time elapses, residents will be redirected to the relying party user interface.
{% endhint %}

6\. The resident should now click the **Allow** button. The system navigates the resident to the **User Profile** page which displays all the personal information based on the consent provided.
