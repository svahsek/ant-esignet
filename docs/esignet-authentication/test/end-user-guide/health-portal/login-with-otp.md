# Login with OTP

{% hint style="success" %}
**Prerequisites:**\
The resident is issued with a unique virtual ID for a country's foundation ID. In the below demo application, which is a health portal, the resident is registered with MOSIP and has a valid UIN or VID.
{% endhint %}

1\. On the portal, the resident clicks on the button _**Sign In with eSignet**_.

{% hint style="info" %}
The consent screen is presented solely to the resident if consent has not previously been obtained. Additionally, a timer is incorporated into the Consent screen, allowing the resident to respond within the designated time frame. If the allotted time elapses, residents will be redirected to the relying party user interface.
{% endhint %}

8\. The resident is given the option to choose from a list of Authorized scopes and Voluntary claims. The Essential claims are mandatory and cannot be modified. A **master toggle button** has been added to allow residents to select all the options at once if desired.
