== Knowledge Based Identification

Knowledge Based Identification (KBI) is a security measure to verify the
identity of an individual based on information that is typically known
only to the individual being authenticated. This method relies on the
understanding that the person requesting access to a system or service
possesses certain private information that only the legitimate user
would know.

In KBI, users are often asked to provide answers to specific questions
or prompts that are related to their personal history or identity. These
questions could cover a range of topics like:

[arabic]
. Personal information (e.g., date of birth, address, social security
number)
. Account related details (e.g., last transaction amount, account
creation date)
. Preferences or history (e.g., favorite colour, first pet’s name)

eSignet has expanded its authentication options to include KBI as one of
its factors. With eSignet’s integration capabilities, existing ID
repositories storing user specific details can now be easily integrated
with eSignet. This integration enables OpenID based login, allowing
users to access relying party services seamlessly.

++{++% hint style="`info`" %} Note:

[arabic]
. The authentication factor can be referred to as either Knowledge Based
Authentication (KBA) or Knowledge Based Identification (KBI). However,
from the eSignet’s perspective, we will specifically refer to the
authentication method as Knowledge Based Identification (KBI).
. Given the relatively low level of assurance provided by Knowledge
Based Identification (KBI), we recommend that Knowledge Based
Authentication (KBA) / Knowledge Based Identification (KBI) should be
used for the issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VC) or certificates
rather than serving as a primary method of authentication. ++{++%

The below mentioned scenario describes a user attempting to download a
VC (Verifiable Credential) from the list of VC issuers through their
mobile wallet (for example., Inji Wallet). The user is verified using
Knowledge Based Identification (KBI) through eSignet.

==== Prerequisite:

[arabic]
. The Resident has installed a mobile wallet (for example., Inji app) on
their mobile device
. The Resident has received the policy number from their insurance
provider, which would be required for KBI

==== Steps

[arabic]
. The resident accesses their digital wallet (e.g., Inji Wallet) and
taps on the plus '`{plus}`' button.
. Resident selects their preferred issuer from the available list.
. Resident provides their *Policy Number*, *Full Name*, and *Date of
Birth* as credentials for KBI login.
. The resident clicks on the Login button.
. Upon successful completion, the user downloads their Insurance Card
into their digital wallet (Inji Wallet).
