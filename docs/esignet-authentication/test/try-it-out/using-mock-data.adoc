== Using Mock Data

While you want to explore eSignet, you can use the following test
personas in our Collab environment.

=== Personas

Individual images are included to facilitate *selfie authentication* for
the Inji application.

Please select the appropriate image file corresponding to the chosen UIN
above.

++{++% hint style="`info`" %} *Note:* The data used for these Virtual
IDs (VIDs) is entirely fictitious, and the images displayed are
AI-generated from an https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en[external

==== Steps to use eSignet

We have developed a *mock health portal* that functions as a *relying
party web portal*. As an end user, you can simulate accessing online
health services by logging in with your *national ID* via eSignet.

==== OTP Authentication

To simplify testing with mock data, eSignet supports OTP authentication.

* You can use any of the provided
link:using-mock-data.md#personas[personas] above for testing.
* The default OTP for testing is "`111111`" (six ones).

For a step-by-step guide on logging in with OTP using eSignet, refer to
link:../end-user-guide/health-portal/login-with-otp.md[this detailed
guide].
