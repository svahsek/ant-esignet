== Relying Party

In the context of *eSignet*, a Relying Party refers to any external
service provider or application that integrates with the eSignet
platform to leverage its secure identity authentication and verification
capabilities. By relying on eSignet as a trusted Identity Provider
(IdP), these service providers can streamline user onboarding and access
management, while maintaining a high level of security, privacy, and
regulatory compliance.

eSignet enables Relying Parties to authenticate users based on verified
identity data, including biometric authentication and government-issued
credentials, without the need to build or manage their own identity
infrastructure. This allows service providers to focus on delivering
their core services while ensuring that only legitimate users can gain
access.

Whether it’s a financial institution verifying customer identity for KYC
compliance, a healthcare provider granting access to medical records, or
a digital service requiring strong authentication, eSignet serves as the
central identity authority that these services trust.
