=== Overview

The 1.3.0 version of eSignet focuses on launching new features in
authentication modes and support for Sign-up service:

[arabic]
. *Password based Authentication*
+
We are thrilled to share that eSignet has expanded its authentication
capabilities with the introduction of a password-based authentication
factor which is a robust and reliable authentication factor secure with
Captcha.
. *Support for Sign-up service*
+
Users now have the convenience of registering through our Sign-Up
Service, seamlessly integrated with the ID repository without complete
deployment of MOSIP Identity. In isolation with the Sign-Up Service,
efficiently manages user registrations.
. *Fixes for known VCI issues from v1.2.0*
