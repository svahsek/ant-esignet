== v1.2.0

*Release Name*: eSignet VCI

*Release Number:* v1.2.0

*Release Date*: 11th December, 2023

=== Overview

The 1.2.0 version of eSignet focuses on the link:broken-reference[*VC
Issuance*] feature.

* *Verifiable Credentials Issuance*: eSignet is an OAuth 2.0 and
OIDC-based solution that has been enhanced to support OID4VCI flows.
Integrating the eSignet VCI solution into a traditional issuer, allows
the issuer application to become compliant with OID4VCI standards,
ensuring interoperability with all OID4VCI compatible wallets.
* *Signed Consent*: eSignet securely saves the consent in a dedicated
consent registry that is specifically designed to store user consent for
claims and scopes requested during the initial login to a relying
partyâ€™s application using eSignet.
* *PKCE Security extension added*: We also provide support for the
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636[PKCE] security extension, which
allows for the secure exchange of an authorization code for a token.
This guarantees that the authorization code was obtained by the client
application itself during the exchange process.
* *Multiple wallet support:* Mobile wallet-based authentication can be
employed to scan a QR code and complete the authentication process
utilizing the previously activated credentials for online login.
Moreover, facial authentication can occur on the wallet to ensure the
presence of the authorized individual is verified.
* *Language Support for eSignet:* The eSignet user interface (UI) offers
comprehensive language support to facilitate effective communication. By
default, eSignet includes language bundles for Arabic, English, Hindi,
Kannada, and Tamil. Moreover, it can be easily customized to incorporate
additional languages as necessary to accommodate specific country
requirements. Furthermore, eSignet has undergone meticulous testing to
ensure seamless compatibility with right-to-left (RTL) languages. This
means that users can rely on eSignet to confidently navigate and
interact with RTL content.
