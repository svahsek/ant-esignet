== Standards & Security

eSignet is built on industry-leading security standards, ensuring robust
privacy and data protection. It implements
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0-final.html[OpenID
Connect Core 1.0] and https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth 2.0], leveraging the
most secure and trusted authentication flows to safeguard user
identities.

===== 1. Security

* *Biometric Integration via SBI* +
eSignet integrates with the
https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3167/10925/[*Secure Biometric Interface
(SBI)*] to support a wide range of biometric service providers. +
Please refer the links below for the SBI library to enable the biometric
auth with eSignet

* *HSM Integration with PKCS #11* +
eSignet supports *Hardware Security Module (HSM)* integration using
*PKCS #11* for the secure storage and management of signing keys.

===== 2. Interoperability

* *Verifiable Credentials & Wallet Integration* +
eSignet adopts *OpenID standards* to support *verifiable credentials*
and *wallet-based identity verification*, enabling seamless
cross-platform interoperability.
* *Identity Assurance (Introduced in v1.5.0)* +
From version *v1.5.0*, eSignet includes support for
link:../esignet-authentication/features.md#identity-assurance-flow-ekyc-verification[*Identity
Assurance*] *under OpenID Connect*, allowing retrieval of verified user
claims and associated metadata.
* *well-knowns* +
eSignet implements *well-known to publish the URI for metadata
discovery*. Below are the supporting standardized .well-known endpoints
for dynamic service configuration and discovery.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|*Name* |*URL Paths*
|OpenID Configuration |/.well-known/openid-configuration
|Jwks Json |/.well-known/jwks.json
|Authorization Server |/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
| |

===== 2. Supported Standards and RFCs

eSignet provides a limited implementation of the OpenID protocol,
supporting the following RFCs and standards:

*a. OAuth 2.0 Standards:*

* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749] -

*b. Token and Discovery Standards:*

* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html[RFC 7515] - JSON Web
Signature
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517[RFC 7517] - JSON Web
Keys
* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519[RFC 7519] - ID token and access
token as JWT
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414[OAuth 2.0 RFC 8414] -
Authorization Server Metadata
* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5785[RFC 5785]- Followed for both
openid and oauth well-knowns

*c. Identity Proofing and security:*

* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html[Identity
Assurance 1.0]
* https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html[IEEE
SA P3167 SBI 2.0]

===== 3. Supported Authentication Flows

As eSignet incorporates *OpenID Connect*, a wide range of client
libraries are available for seamless integration. Therefore, it is
recommended to avoid creating custom code for the integration process.

eSignet implements and supports only the flows mentioned below:

[width="100%",cols="30%,37%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|*Standards* |*Flow* |*Client Authentication*
|OAuth 2.0 |Authorization Code with PKCE |private-key-jwt
|OIDC |Authorization Code with PKCE |private-key-jwt
|Identity Assurance 1.0 |Authorization Code with PKCE |private-key-jwt
|===

*Note:* eSignet supports *confidential clients only*, adhering to the
principle of *security by design*.

===== 4. Security Enhancements

* *Authorization Code Flow* – Exchanges an authorization code for a
token, requiring client authentication.
* *Private-key-jwt -* Our supported client authentication method is
private-key-jwt only which ensures that the token is given to a
legitimate client.
* *PKCE* - We also support the
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636[PKCE](Proof Key for Code
Exchange) security extension for exchanging an authorization code for a
token, which guarantees that the authorization code was obtained by the
same client application performing the code exchange.

*Note:* eSignet currently supports the S256 challenge method in its PKCE
implementation.

===== 5. eSignet as OAuth 2.0 server

eSignet’s OAuth 2.0 implementation is a lightweight solution designed
specifically for OIDC authentication flows. It does not function as a
full-fledged authorization server but provides the essential
capabilities required for identity verification and kyc. Additionally,
eSignet:

* *Does not support role-based access control* - As it is designed for
integration with national-level identity solutions, where predefined
roles are not necessary for residents.
