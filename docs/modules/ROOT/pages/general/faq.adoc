How to configure password authentication in eSignet?

To enable password authentication in Signet for a client, you must first
set the ACR value as “*mosip:idp:acr:password*” in the
*_authContextRefs_* array during client creation or update.

During local testing follow the below format**:**

You must modify or add a file named “*_amr-acr-mapping.json”_* in
*_esignet-service ++>>++ src ++>>++ main ++>>++ resources,_* which
should contain all ACR and AMR mapping where you can add
*“mosip:idp:acr:password”* and *“PWD”* as shown below.

[source,json]
----
{
 "amr": {
  ...
  "PWD" : [{ "type": "PWD" }],
  ...
 },
 "acr_amr": {
  ...
  "mosip:idp:acr:password" : ["PWD"],
  ...
 }
}
----

Once these properties have been added to the file, you can refer to this
file in “*_application-local.properties”_* in the same folder location.

[source,properties]
----
mosip.esignet.amr-acr-mapping-file-url=classpath:amr-acr-mapping.json
----

Or

You can directly point to a URL from the deployed version using the
*_mosip-config_* repo where the *_acr++_++amr++_++mapping_*
configuration is stored for production, as shown below.

[source,properties]
----
mosip.esignet.amr-acr-mapping-file-url=https://raw.githack.com/mosip/mosip-config/develop-v3/amr-acr-mapping.json
----

Similarly, for production follow the below format:

You have to change *_acr-amr-mapping.json_* in the *_mosip-config_*
repo; depending on your environment, switch to that branch and add the
*“PWD”* property in the *_amr_* and *“mosip:idp:acr:password”* in the
*_acr++_++amr_*.

How to add a new language in eSignet?

To add a new language for the local eSignet setup follow the below
steps**:**

[arabic]
. Go to your Signet project and then open the folder: +
*oidc-ui ++>>++ public ++>>++ locales*
. Create a new language JSON file
[arabic]
.. Copy the file _en.json_ and rename it with your new language’s code
as per ISO 639-1 (for example, if you want to add the language French,
then rename the file to _fr.json)_ so that you can have all keys in for
your new language.
.. Modify the values in your desired language (for French, the values
have to be modified to French in the _fr.json_ file)
. Update `default.json` file
[arabic]
.. Now add the new language’s JSON file detail in _the default.json_
file so that it can be parsed and the new language can be shown in the
UI, like below.
.. You have to add the ISO 639-1 (two-lettered language code) language
info in languages++_++2Letters (which was used to create the new file
above) and also put the language value against it.
.. If your language follows RTL(right-to-left) then add ISO 639-1
language code in the `rtlLanguages` array.
.. Finally, create a mapping between ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-1 language
codes for your language in `langCodeMapping`.

[source,json]
----
{
  // Add your new language here
  "languages_2Letters": {
    "en": "English",
    "ar": "عربى",
    "LANGUAGE_CODE_IN_ISO-639-1": "LANGUAGE VALUE"
  },
  // Add your new language in rtlLanguages if it uses RTL
  "rtlLanguages": ["ar"],
  // Add a language mapping for ISO 639-2 & ISO 639-1 format
  "langCodeMapping": {
    "eng": "en",
    "ara": "ar",
    "LANGUAGE_CODE_IN_ISO-639-2": "LANGUAGE_CODE_IN_ISO-639-1"
  }
}
----

For details on ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2, please follow the
https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php[documentation
here].

*Adding a new language in the production setup*

Similar to the local mentioned above, you need to create a new language
JSON file (as per ISO 639-1 and then update language configurations in
_the *default.json*_ file.

Apart from that, you have to make the above changes in the `develop`
branch of your
https://github.com/mosip/artifactory-ref-impl/tree/develop[*_artifactory-ref-impl_*]
repository. To do so,

[arabic]
. Clone the repo and switch to the `develop` branch.
. Go to the folder location: +
*artifacts ++>>++ src ++>>++ i18n ++>>++ esignet-i18n-bundle*
. Inside this folder, you can view all language JSON files.
. Create your new language file as mentioned in the local setup guide
above and place it in the folder.
. Modify the *_default.json_* file as mentioned in the local setup guide
above.

Now, use this new artifactory in your production setup.

How to remove a language from the eSignet default setup?

To remove a language from the default eSignet setup, you have to remove
or delete the language’s JSON file (let’s say French _fr.json_) from
your language bundle.

After that, you need to remove the mapping and details from the
*_default.json_* file of that particular language.

*For local setup:*

Go to the folder *_oidc-ui ++>>++ public ++>>++ locales_* in the
e-Signet project and perform the above steps.

*In production:*

Go to the develop branch of your
https://github.com/mosip/artifactory-ref-impl/tree/develop[*_artifactory-ref-impl_*]
and perform the above steps in this location: _*artifacts ++>>++ src
++>>++ i18n ++>>++ esignet-i18n-bundle*._ Once the artifactory is
modified, then you can deploy the latest version in production.

How to integrate wallets with eSignet to provide wallet-based
authentication?

To integrate a wallet in eSignet:

You have to add wallet details in *_application-local.properties_* in
the *_esignet-service_* module in your esignet project.

[source,properties]
----
mosip.esignet.ui.wallet.config={{'wallet.name': 'Inji', 'wallet.logo-url': 'inji_logo.png', 'wallet.download-uri': '#', 'wallet.deep-link-uri': 'inji://landing-page-name?linkCode=LINK_CODE&linkExpireDateTime=LINK_EXPIRE_DT' }}
----

Here, you need to specify the below mentioned properties:

* wallet.name
* wallet.logo-url
* wallet.download-uri
* wallet.deep-link-uri

*Note*: In this property, you can also configure multiple wallets.

After adding the above details you should add this variable in the
*_wallet.config_* properties of *_mosip.esignet.ui.config.key-values_*
configuration as shown below.

[source,properties]
----
mosip.esignet.ui.config.key-values={…
 'wallet.config': ${mosip.esignet.ui.wallet.config}}
----

Then, restart the eSignet UI and eSignet backend service to view the
changes.
