== End User Guide

In this user guide, we demonstrate how the *eSignet Sign-Up Service* can
be integrated using a health services portal as the relying party. The
Sign-Up Service provides a seamless registration experience, allowing
users to create an account through a standardized and secure portal.
When users access the health services portal for the first time, they
are redirected to the eSignet Sign-Up Portal to complete their
registration.

Once signed up, users are prompted to complete a *video eKYC (electronic
Know Your Customer)* process on their first login. This ensures verified
digital identity, leveraging their countryâ€™s foundational ID system and
eliminates the need to repeatedly enter personal information. This
integration enables trusted digital onboarding and simplifies access to
government and health services.
