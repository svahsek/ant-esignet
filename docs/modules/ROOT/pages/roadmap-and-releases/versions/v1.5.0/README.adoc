== v1.5.0

*Release Name*: v.1.5.0

*Release Date*: 23rd Jan, 2025

==== *Overview*

We are excited to announce the release of eSignet v1.5.0, featuring the
key implementation of Identity Assurance 1.0 (Draft). This open standard
enhances eSignet’s ability to verify and authenticate identities more
assuredly, laying the foundation for the newly supported video-based
eKYC verification plugin. In addition to this core feature, the release
includes security fixes and several architectural updates to streamline
workflows and enhance the overall user and developer experience.

==== *Features*

real-time video verification during registration.

embedded deeplink for seamless access within the same device.

==== Major Highlights

[arabic]

with Docker-Compose*]
* Removed artifactory and config Server dependencies, enabling local
eSignet deployment via docker-compose for easier setup and environment
management. 
. https://github.com/mosip/esignet-plugins/tree/develop[*eSignet-Plugins
Repository Updates*]
* eSignet-plugins repository for better compatibility and functionality.
. https://github.com/mosip/captcha[*Captcha Validation Improvements*]
* Enhanced captcha validation for improved security and fewer
vulnerabilities.
. https://docs.mosip.io/inji/inji-certify/overview[*VC Issuance
migration to Inji Certify*]
* eSignet no longer supports VC issuance. This functionality was
supported up to eSignet v1.4.2. INJI Certify now handles VC issuance.
The documentation has been updated to reflect this change.
