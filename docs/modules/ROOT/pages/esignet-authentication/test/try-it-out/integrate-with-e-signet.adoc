== Integrate with eSignet

If you are a relying party looking to integrate with *eSignet,* you can
connect with us by completing the
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YQKcBDR92uqy_0m6oIV5yLmCPQCGOqJYx043ZOWQnX8/edit[form]
here. This will assist us in facilitating a seamless integration on
https://collab.mosip.net/[collab].

Here are some FAQs on the Google form.

What are redirect URIs?

The redirect URIs are the list of URIs the relying party provides where
the authorization code needs to be sent after successful authentication
by eSignet.

Why do you need a public key?

The public key shared by the relying party is used to verify the digital
signature when there is an authorization request. It is also used to
encrypt the `user++_++info` and send it to the relying party.

What is JWK format?

JWK (JSON Web Key) is a JSON data structure that represents a set of
public keys utilizing either the Elliptic Curve or RSA families of
algorithms (public key cryptography).

How can I convert a public key to JWK format?

Here is the easiest way to convert your public key (a `.PEM` file) to
JWK format for testing.

* Go to the link https://russelldavies.github.io/jwk-creator/
* Select *Public Key Use* as *Signing*
* Select *Algorithm* as *RS256*
* Select *Key ID* as *alpha-numeric-random-string*
* Paste the public key PEM file content in *PEM encoded key*
* Click on the *convert* button

Once you receive the eSignet credentials at the email address provided
on the form, please go through our integration guide on
link:../../../esignet-authentication/develop/integration/relying-party/README.md[Relying
Party Integration] to complete the integration.
