++{++% hint style="`info`" %} The consent screen is presented solely to
the resident if consent has not previously been obtained. Additionally,
a timer is incorporated into the consent screen, allowing the resident
to respond within the designated time frame. If the allotted time
elapses, residents will be redirected to the relying party user
interface. ++{++% endhint %}

{empty}6. The resident is given the option to choose from a list of
authorized scopes and voluntary claims. The essential claims are
mandatory and cannot be modified. In eSignet, a "`*master toggle
button*`" has been added to allow residents to select all the options at
once if desired.
