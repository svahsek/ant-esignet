== eSignet Authentication

=== Overview

*eSignet Auth* is a modular, standalone identity authentication service
designed to enable secure and flexible user verification across digital
ecosystems. Built on *open standards*, it implements *OAuth 2.0 and
OpenID Connect* protocols, functioning as both an *authorization server*
and a *resource server*.

===== 1. Designed for Inclusivity

eSignet Auth ensures that digital authentication is accessible and
adaptable for all, regardless of device type or user capability.

* *Multiple Authentication Factors* +
Supports a variety of methods including *OTP* (for feature phones),
*biometrics* (iris, face, fingerprint), and *wallet-based face
authentication* (for smartphone users). These modes ensure inclusive
access across different user demographics and contexts.
* *Customizable Authentication Workflows* +
Flexible by design, eSignet Auth can be tailored to meet
country-specific, sector-specific, or application-specific requirements.
New authentication methods can be easily added and existing flows
modified without major system changes.

===== 2. Standards-Based ID Authentication with High Assurance

eSignet Auth delivers secure identity verification through a
*standards-compliant* and *assurance-driven* approach.

* *OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Based* +
Uses established OAuth 2.0 flows and OpenID Connect for secure,
token-based identity authentication, enabling seamless and reliable
integration with existing systems.
* *Support for High Assurance Biometrics* +
Enables robust identity authentication using *iris*, *face*, or
*fingerprint* recognition. These high-assurance modalities are ideal for
accessing sensitive services such as healthcare, financial services, and
government platforms.

This combination of standards compliance and biometric authentication
ensures strong, verifiable digital identities with configurable
assurance levels.

===== 3. How It Builds Trust

Trust is foundational to eSignet Auth’s architecture, achieved through
strong privacy controls, consent-driven design, and secure token
handling.

* *Consented User Data Sharing* +
Personal data is shared only after explicit, informed user consent. The
consent flow is embedded into the authentication process and mandatory
for data access.
* *No Data Storage* +
eSignet Auth does *not store any personally identifiable information
(PII)*. It acts solely as a verification and authentication layer,
reducing exposure to privacy risks.
* *Prevention of Unwanted Profiling* +
Issues *partner-specific user tokens* for each relying party, ensuring
that user activity cannot be tracked or correlated across services—thus
preserving privacy and stopping cross-service profiling.

===== 4. Seamless Integration Across Ecosystems

eSignet Auth is built for flexibility, allowing it to plug into various
components across digital identity and service delivery ecosystems.

* *Compatible with Any ID System* +
Integrates easily with any centralized or federated identity system. Its
standards-based framework allows it to work with a wide variety of ID
registries and data structures.
* *Connects with Any Relying Party (Service Portal)* +
Service providers—such as banks, government departments, healthcare
portals, and telecom services—can authenticate users through eSignet
Auth with minimal integration effort. The use of standard APIs and
protocols enables quick and secure onboarding.

This ecosystem-agnostic design ensures that eSignet Auth can serve as a
unifying layer for identity authentication across sectors.
