== Wallet Authenticator

For a digital wallet to function as an authenticator using eSignet, it
is necessary to have the user’s credentials and ensure that the user’s
ID in the credential is securely linked to eSignet.

++{++% hint style="`info`" %} *Note:* For details on how to get the
user’s credentials downloaded on eSignet, please refer to the document
on - link:credential-holder.md[How a digital wallet can be used as
credential holder?]

For details on how binding is performed in eSignet, please refer to the
document on - link:../key-binder.md[eSignet’s Key Binding Plugin].
++{++% endhint %}

In this document, we will be discussing the application programming
interfaces (APIs) that need to be invoked by the wallet application for
executing the process of binding and subsequently performing wallet
local authentication.

=== Wallet Binding APIs

As previously stated, before initiating authentication in eSignet, it is
necessary to associate the user’s ID with the wallet’s public key.

eSignet offers endpoints to request a one-time password (OTP) for this
association, followed by another API to bind the public key of the
wallet to the user’s ID.

Here, the challenge can be the OTP or any other authentication type
supported by eSignet, like biometrics.

Once the user successfully completes the binding process, their wallet
will be assigned a unique user ID and receive a signed certificate from
eSignet. This certificate will have an expiration time, and as a result,
it will be necessary for the user to periodically reinitiate the wallet
binding. It is important for the wallet to securely store this
certificate and associate it with the respective Wallet User ID for
proper mapping.

++{++% hint style="`info`" %} When multiple VIDs are bound to a public
key using a specific type of wallet, they will consistently produce the
same Wallet User ID. However, only the most recent certificate signed by
eSignet will hold validity. Therefore, if a user switches to a new
device and proceeds to bind their wallet on that device, any signed
certificates saved on the previous device will no longer be valid.
++{++% endhint %}

=== Wallet Authentication APIs

To utilize the wallet with a secured credential for authentication,
users are required to follow these steps:

* Firstly, users need to visit a relying party website that has enabled
eSignet authentication through the wallet.
* Next, users should use the wallet application to scan the QR code
provided on the website. This will establish a connection and initiate
the authentication process.
* The wallet application will identify a link code within the QR code,
which is essential for initiating the authentication.
* To begin the authentication, the wallet will send the link code to the
eSignet server using the
*_"`/linked-authorization/v2/link-transaction`"_* endpoint.
* Once the transaction has been successfully initiated, the eSignet
server will respond by providing a list of authentication factors known
as WLA (Wallet Local Authentication).
* The wallet will then proceed to authenticate the user locally,
possibly by comparing a selfie with the existing credentials stored on
the phone.
* Upon successful local authentication on the wallet, it should generate
a signed JWT (JSON Web Token) using the provided signed certificate from
the wallet binding process.
* Subsequently, the wallet will send the signed JWT to the eSignet
server via the "`/link-authorization/v2/authenticate`" endpoint, using
WLA as the challenge.
* After the process of authentication is completed successfully, the
eSignet server will proceed to send the consent action.
* The consent action can have two possible values: CAPTURE or NO
CAPTURE. These values indicate whether the user should capture their
consent or not.
* In the event that the authentication response includes a consent
action of CAPTURE, the wallet will prompt the user to provide their
consent. The wallet will then proceed to share the captured consent with
the eSignet server through the use of the
*_"`/link-authorization/v2/consent`"_* endpoint.
* The eSignet user interface now can automatically detect when consent
has been given by the user. Subsequently, the authentication code will
be sent to the redirect URI of the relying party.
