# Mock Identity System

This is a mock implementation of an identity system. We provide this system so developers can use it for local development and testing of eSignet.

The mock system can be run with endpoints to,

* create an individual
* get an individual's data
* authenticate an individual
* send an OTP
* share KYC data about the individual post-authentication

Below are the authentication factors supported:

* PIN-based authentication
* OTP authentication
* Biometric authentication
