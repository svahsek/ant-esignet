== Components - Signup Portal

The image below is a block diagram of the sign up portal comprising
various components along with the different layers and external systems.

Signup components

=== *Signup UI*

This is the user interface component of the Signup portal is developed
using React JS. Its main functionality is to handle user registration
and eKYC verification. Signup UI seamlessly integrates with the UI REST
endpoints provided by the signup service. The Signup UI supports
multiple languages. Signup UI verifies the OTP before the user
registration. A notable feature added in the signup UI is to carry out
video-based eKYC verification.

=== Signup Service

This service is the primary backend spring Java application that
incorporates various layers.

[arabic]
. *Services:* This layer defines the services implemented in the signup
service. Registration service implements all the business logic related
to OTP verification and the registration process. As we currently
support a video-based online eKYC verification process, it requires
two-way communication between UI and the backend service. To support
this we establish a WS connection between signup UI and signup service,
WebSocket Handler manages the WebSocket connection. eKYC verification
service contains the logic to initiate and manage the eKYC verification
transaction.
. *Rest APIs:* This layer exposes REST endpoints for the functionality
implemented in the service layer.
. *Cache Layer:* The signup service maintains complete transaction
details in the cache. Currently, supports “simple” and “redis” cache
types.
. *Plugins*: Integration points with external systems are designed to be
pluggable, allowing easy integration. The pluggable integration points
are as follows:
* link:integration-guide-signup-portal/profile-registry-plugin.md[*Profile
Registry Plugin*]- To create and update user identity data
* link:integration-guide-signup-portal/identity-verifier-plugin.md[*Identity
Verifier Plugin*] - Plugin to verify the user identity data, basically
the backend for the eKYC verification process.
* link:../../esignet-authentication/develop/integration/audit.md[*Audit
Plugin*] - For auditing all events
. *Reused*: Modules from the MOSIP platform and eSignet are reused in
the Signup service instead of rewriting the existing logic.

=== eKYC Verifiers

Trusted claim providers are authorized(depending on policies and
regulations) to carry out an identity verification process in which the
user is asked to provide proof and prove legitimacy concerning the
user’s account.

=== ID Registry

An ID Registry is a system or database that stores and manages identity
information about individuals or entities. An ID Registry is a critical
part of digital identity management, acting as a centralized repository
for authenticating and verifying the identity of users. +
In the context of the Signup Portal, the ID Registry could refer to any
external system or service that stores user identity information. When a
user registers, the Signup Service may interact with an ID registry to
validate and store details like the user’s email, phone number, or even
government-issued ID, ensuring that the identity is legitimate and
unique.
